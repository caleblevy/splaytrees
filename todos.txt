# Break SplayTree into SplayABC, with all methods concrete except the crucial
  splaying step.
# Have two trees: SimpleSplayTree and SplayTree
# Do more to codify the public interfaces: i.e. successor should raise error if
  at max. But don't overdue it; we don't need to get rid of the LUB objects
  yet.
# Add "preorder stack", preorder traversal, construct tree from preorder,
  compare tree from preorder.
# Add equality and identity methods.
# Add uniformly random tree maker.
# Make benchmarks comparing splay trees, binary trees, sorting, and whatnot.
  Check for that linear time.
