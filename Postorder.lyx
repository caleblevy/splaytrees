\begin_layout Abstract
Define 
\emph on
splay insertion 
\emph default
by first inserting a node into a tree at the location where the binary search
 hits a null node, and then splaying that node.
 We prove that starting from an empty tree, splay-insertion of a sequence
 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 which is a postorder for some tree takes 
\begin_inset Formula $3\left|X\right|$
\end_inset

We define the postorder sequence of a tree 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 in the usual recursive way: letting 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\root\left(T\right)$
\end_inset

, we define 
\begin_inset Formula $\postorder\left(T\right)=\left(\postorder\left(\leftnode\left(x\right)\right),\postorder\left(\rightnode\left(x\right)\right),x\right)$
\end_inset

, where the postorder of an empty tree is empty.

The following definitions and theorems are modelled directly after

\end_inset

.
 Two sequences 
\begin_inset Formula $A=\left(a_{1}\dots a_{n}\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B=\left(b_{1}\dots b_{n}\right)$
\end_inset

 of the same length are 
\emph on
order-isomorphic 
\emph default
if their entries have the same relative order, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}<a_{j}\iff b_{i}<b_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 Hence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(581\right)$
\end_inset

 is order-isomorphic to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(231\right)$
\end_inset

.
 A sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is 
\emph on

\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

-avoiding 
\emph default
if it has no subsequence that is order-isomorphic with 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

, otherwise we say it contains 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

-avoiding, then all subsequences of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 are 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

-avoding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
A sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 is a postorder if and only if it is 
\begin_inset Formula $312$
\end_inset

-avoding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
We define a bijection that maps arbitrary 
\begin_inset Formula $312$
\end_inset

-avoiding permutations to a BST over 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[n\right]$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 be a 
\begin_inset Formula $312$
\end_inset

-avoiding permutation of length 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $L=\left(\pi_{1}\dots\pi_{k}\right)$
\end_inset

 be the longest contiguous subsequence of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 consisting of elements less than 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Observe that all elements in 
\begin_inset Formula $R=\left(\pi_{k+1}\dots\pi_{n-1}\right)$
\end_inset

 are greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{n}$
\end_inset

, for otherwise 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 would have a subsequence order-isomorphic to 
\begin_inset Formula $312$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In particular, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\pi_{k+1},\pi_{m},\pi_{n}\right)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $k+1<m<n$
\end_inset

 would be isomorphic to 
\begin_inset Formula $312$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 (One of both 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 may be empty.) By induction, we build a BST with 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{n}$
\end_inset

 as the root and the BSTs recursively built from 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 as the left, respectively right subtree of the root.
 (The BST built of an empty sequence is empty.) The map is injective by induction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
The reverse mapping is as follows: given a BST 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

, build a permutation 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{n}=\root\left(T\right)$
\end_inset

, preceeded by the sequences 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{L}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{R}$
\end_inset

 built recursively from the left, respectively right subtree of 
\begin_inset Formula $\root\left(T\right)$
\end_inset

.
 (The sequence built of an empty BST is empty).
 The resulting permutation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 is known as the postorder sequence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
We argue that 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $312$
\end_inset

-avoiding.
 By induction, 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{L}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{R}$
\end_inset

 are 
\begin_inset Formula $312$
\end_inset

-avoiding.
 Suppose for contradiction that 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 contains a subsequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x,y,z\right)$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $y<z<x$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $z=\pi_{n}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 cannot be in 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{L}$
\end_inset

, since entries of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{L}$
\end_inset

 are smaller than 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 But then 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 is in 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{R}$
\end_inset

, contradicting 
\begin_inset Formula $y<z$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 is in 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{R}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 must be in 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{L}$
\end_inset

 (since otherwise 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{R}$
\end_inset

 would contain 
\begin_inset Formula $312$
\end_inset

), this time contradicting that 
\begin_inset Formula $z<x$
\end_inset

.
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 are in 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{L}$
\end_inset

, contradicting that 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{L}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $312$
\end_inset

-avoiding.

\begin_layout Section
Insertion Trees
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An insertion tree for a permutation 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 is the binary search tree obtained by starting from an empty tree and inserting
 nodes in order of their first appearence in 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

, with no further adjustment in between.
 Alternatively, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi\in S_{n}$
\end_inset

, then the insertion tree 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\treap\left(\left(1\dots n\right),\pi\right)=\treap\left(\pi\right)$
\end_inset

, as defined by Kozma.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following lemma has been observed in a more general form many times.
 Despite being very intuitively straightforward, the proof given here is
 surprisingly tedious.
 I suspect it can be made more elegant.
 I provide the proof here for completeness, since it is central to proving
 postorder insertion takes linear time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Lemma
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 be a permutation.
 Then both the paths encountered by using splay-insert on the nodes of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 starting from an empty tree, and the final tree produced by doing so, will
 be identical those obtained by splaying the sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 starting from 
\begin_inset Formula $\treap\left(\pi\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
We prove by induction on the length of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi=\varnothing$
\end_inset

 then there are no splay paths and both procedures end in an empty tree.
 Assume the lemma is true for permutations of length at most 
\begin_inset Formula $n-1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi=\left(\pi_{1}\dots\pi_{n}\right)$
\end_inset

, and denote 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{<n}=\left(\pi_{1}\dots\pi_{n-1}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Define 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{0}=\treap\left(\pi\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{0}'=\treap\left(\pi_{<n}\right)$
\end_inset

, and for 
\begin_inset Formula $1\le i\le n-1$
\end_inset

 denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{i}'$
\end_inset

 the trees obtained by splaying 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{i}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{i-1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{i-1}'$
\end_inset

, respectively.
 We claim that 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{i}$
\end_inset

 is formed by adding 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{n}$
\end_inset

 as a leaf of 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{i}'$
\end_inset

.
 Clearly this is true of 
\begin_inset Formula $i=0$
\end_inset

.
 Consider the following two properties of splaying:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
splaying cannot alter the shapes of subtrees rooted at children of nodes
 along a splay path, and 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
the final positions of all nodes in a splay path, and all subtrees of nodes
 on the splay path, depend solely on the shape of the splay path prior to
 splaying.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Proof
Suppose the claim is true for 
\begin_inset Formula $1\le i\le k-1<n-1$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k-1}$
\end_inset

 is formed by adding 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{n}$
\end_inset

 as a leaf to 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k-1}'$
\end_inset

.
 Observe that: 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
the access paths for 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{k}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k-1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k-1}'$
\end_inset

 will be identical.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
all subtrees hanging from the access path in 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k-1}$
\end_inset

 will be identical to those in 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k-1}'$
\end_inset

, except that one of the subtrees in 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k-1}$
\end_inset

 will contain 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{n}$
\end_inset

 added as a leaf.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
After the splay, the nodes of the access paths in 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k}'$
\end_inset

 will have the same positions, and the subtrees of the access paths will
 also be positioned identically, with both sets of subtrees unaltered in
 their shape.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Proof
Hence all nodes in 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k}'$
\end_inset

 will have identical positions, except 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{n}$
\end_inset

 which is situated as a leaf of some subtree in 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k}'$
\end_inset

.
 We thus have that 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{i}$
\end_inset

 is obtained by inserting 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{n}$
\end_inset

 as a leaf of 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{i}'$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $1\le i\le n-1$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
We may now summarize:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The 
\emph on
splay paths
\emph default
 encountered by splaying 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{<n}$
\end_inset

 starting from 
\begin_inset Formula $\treap\left(\pi\right)$
\end_inset

 are identical to those encountered by splaying 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{<n}$
\end_inset

 starting from 
\begin_inset Formula $\treap\left(\pi_{<n}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 (By the above arguments.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The 
\emph on
tree 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{n-1}$
\end_inset

 produced
\emph default
 by splaying 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{<n}$
\end_inset

 starting from 
\begin_inset Formula $\treap\left(\pi\right)$
\end_inset

 is the same as the tree 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{n-1}'$
\end_inset

 produced by splaying 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{<n}$
\end_inset

 starting from 
\begin_inset Formula $\treap\left(\pi_{<n}\right)$
\end_inset

 and then inserting 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{n}$
\end_inset

 as a leaf.
 (By the above arguments.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The 
\emph on
splay paths 
\emph default
encountered by splay-inserting the nodes of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{<n}$
\end_inset

 are the same as the splay paths encountered by splaying the nodes of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{<n}$
\end_inset

 starting from 
\begin_inset Formula $\treap\left(\pi_{<n}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 (By the original inductive hypothesis.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The 
\emph on
tree produced
\emph default
 by splay-inserting the nodes of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{<n}$
\end_inset

 is the same as that produced by splaying the sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{<n}$
\end_inset

 starting from 
\begin_inset Formula $\treap\left(\pi_{<n}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 (By the original inductive hypothesis.)
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Proof
Hence, the splay paths encountered by splaying 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{<n}$
\end_inset

 starting from 
\begin_inset Formula $\treap\left(\pi\right)$
\end_inset

 are the same as 
\emph on
splay-inserting
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{<n}$
\end_inset

.
 When we go to 
\emph on
splay-insert
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{n}$
\end_inset

, we will insert it as a leaf into 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{n-1}'$
\end_inset

.
 By the symmetric order constraints, its position will be identical to that
 of the leaf 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{n}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{n-1}$
\end_inset

.
 To complete the proof, we note that splaying the same node 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{n}$
\end_inset

 in identical trees will result in identical splay paths and identical trees.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of the busywork in that proof seems to be showing that if I add a leaf
 to the starting tree, and then splay the same sequence, then there will
 be no difference in the execution.

\begin_layout Section
Combs (Insertion Trees of Postorders)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Knowing that splay-insertion of a postorder 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 is identical to splaying 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 starting from 
\begin_inset Formula $\treap\left(\pi\right)$
\end_inset

, it is natural to enquire about the nature of 
\begin_inset Formula $\treap\left(\pi\right)$
\end_inset

.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Chaudhuri1991"

\end_inset

, Chaudhuri and and Hoft show that splaying a search tree in its own 
\emph on
preorder
\emph default
 takes linear time.
 The fact 
\begin_inset Formula $\treap\left(\operatorname{preorder}\left(T\right)\right)=T$
\end_inset

 may obscure the fact that this is identical 
\emph on
splay-inserting
\emph default
 in preorder, but their problem is fundamentally identical.
 The insertion trees produced by postorders have a very simple, and somewhat
 surprising structure.
 In what follows, 
\begin_inset Formula $x\prec_{\pi}y$
\end_inset

, or simply 
\begin_inset Formula $x\prec y$
\end_inset

 denotes that 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 precedes 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Lemma
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 be a postorder.
 Then all descendents of left children in 
\begin_inset Formula $\treap\left(\pi\right)$
\end_inset

 are left children.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
We show that we would otherwise obtain a contradiction.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 be a left child in 
\begin_inset Formula $\treap\left(\pi\right)$
\end_inset

 with a proper descendent 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 which is a right child.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $y=\parent\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\parent\left(w\right)$
\end_inset

.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

's right child, 
\begin_inset Formula $y<z$
\end_inset

.
 Because both 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 are descendents of 
\begin_inset Formula $w=\leftnode\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

, they are both in 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

's left subtree, hence 
\begin_inset Formula $y<z<x$
\end_inset

.
 Further, 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 is an ancestor of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is an ancestor of 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
By the properties of the heap-order, 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 can be an ancestor of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 only if 
\begin_inset Formula $y\prec_{\pi}z$
\end_inset

, and similarly we must have 
\begin_inset Formula $x\prec_{\pi}y$
\end_inset

.
 We thus have that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x,y,z\right)$
\end_inset

 is a subsequence of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

, and from the above, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(xyz\right)$
\end_inset

 is order-isomorphic to 
\begin_inset Formula $312$
\end_inset

, meaning 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 is not a postorder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the above, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 is a postorder, 
\begin_inset Formula $T=\treap\left(T\right)$
\end_inset

, the path from 
\begin_inset Formula $\root\left(T\right)$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in T$
\end_inset

 always consists first of zero or more right children followed by zero or
 more left children.
 The shape this describes in general is a

\end_inset

right path
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

left paths
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Its structure is fully specified by the nodes

These combs have several other properties which are not proven here or used
 for this investigation, but which are interesting:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For a postorder 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

, the comb given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\treap\left(\pi\right)$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the maximal subsequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\pi_{a_{1}}\dots\pi_{a_{k}}\right)$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{j}<\pi_{a_{i}}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $j<a_{i}$
\end_inset

, for 
\begin_inset Formula $1\le i\le k$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For every comb 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

, there is a corresponding postorder sequence whose insertion tree is 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

.
 In fact, the 
\emph on
preorder
\emph default
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is also a 
\emph on
postorder
\emph default
 whose insertion tree is 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

.
 Note, however, that the tree whose postorder sequence is 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

's preorder will not (in general) be 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In fact, this tree may be obtained by reversing the labels on the tooth
 of each comb and then rotating the whole tree 
\begin_inset Formula $90^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 counterclockwise!
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Each division of bins on a comb corresponds to an interval partition of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[n\right]$
\end_inset

, which itself corresponds to some subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[n-1\right]$
\end_inset

.
 Hence there are 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{n-1}$
\end_inset

 combs on 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 nodes.
